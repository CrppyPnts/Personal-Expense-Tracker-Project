# Personal Expense Tracker
  a simple expense tracker that uses user input to manage, edit, and track the user's expenses in real time. This is also my first git project showcasing 
  what I've learnt along the years as a CPA student from Fanshawe. While making the project, this also allows me to learn the basics of github and on how to maneuver around the website.

## Languages Used
- Java
  
## Future Improvements
- Instead of using the arraylist to display expenses, make the program read the .txt file instead.
- Using a different .txt file,to implement program re-usage, make the program detect past users so that file either creates a new file ( if its a first for the user) or to use the already made file that the
  user has created before.
  
## How it Works So Far
1. The user will be prompted ot enter their name and then based on their input a .txt file is made called "YourNameExpenseFile.txt". 
2. The user will then input what is to be prompted based on what is on the UI and based on what they choose the program will be tasked to fulfill the user's wants.
3. the data the user has inputted will then be placed onto an ArrayList and then be printed into the user's text file using the PrintWriter class which works as sort of a "mini-database" that stores the data to be reusable for future uses.
4. The user then inputs a number that corresponds to "Exit" when they are done with the program.
   
## How it Runs
- the user has to download both PersonalExpenseTrackerV2.java & Expense.java for the program to work
